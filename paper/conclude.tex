\Section{conclude}{Conclusion}
We implemented a recent paper on adaptive composite map projections, and
  integrated the technique into D3.
Furthermore, we have made a number of improvements in order to robustly
  handle data viewed at non-standard rotations and scales.
Lastly, we have implemented a technique for animating transitions between
  local views which gives the user global context in a visually appealing and
  useful way.
A demo to showcase our approach is online at \url{http://jitouch.com/map}.
