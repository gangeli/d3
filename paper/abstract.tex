Selecting a map projection for a visualization is a challenging problem,
  as different projections are better suited for different purposes, and in
  particular for different scales.
We implemented as an extension to D3 a recent paper on the topic,
  which produces a composite projection between zoom levels and latitudes.
The implementation ensures that a reasonable projection is chosen for any
  given reference frame, and that the transition between these projections
  is seamless.
We extended the method in the paper in two key ways:
  (1) We interpolate paths and handle edge cases more robustly than the paper's
      proof-of-concept implementation, and
  (2) We implemented smooth animations between map locations which provide
      global context for the move.
