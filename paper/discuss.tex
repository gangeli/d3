\Section{discuss}{Discussion and Future Work}
The largest bit of work which we intend to undertake is submitting a pull
  request to D3, in hopes that the extensions will actually be incorporated into
  the distribution.
More conceptually, however, a number of improvements could be made.

Largest among them: the current D3 framework views projections as a mapping
  from points to points.
In this framework, drawing a closed polygon will always draw the inside of the
  region.
This results in the error discussed above, wherein an extremely distorted
  polygon will cover the entire globe.
The principled solution to this, as is being implemented in the most recent
  version of D3, is to specify a polarity for the polygon and shade only the
  region inside.

Relatedly, handling wrapping of polygons would be more elegantly done if the
  polygons are treated as atomic units, rather than a collection of points.
This is also, we hear, in the works for newer D3 versions.

More on the aesthetics side, integration with OpenStreetMap would make for a
  compelling demo.
The challenge there is mapping accurately from their notion of scale to ours,
  and smoothly rescaling tiles as we change zoom levels, as their resolution
   is more fine-grained than the resolution we allow.
