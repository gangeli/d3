\Section{methods}{Implementation}
The code was designed to behave as much as a plug-and-play replacement for
  other projections as possible.
In particular, the public-facing interface for the composite projection is
  very similar to that of other projections, and no functions were introduced
  that did not exist in at least some other projection.
The top-level interface is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \textbf{\texttt{d3.geo.composite()}}
\end{itemize}
